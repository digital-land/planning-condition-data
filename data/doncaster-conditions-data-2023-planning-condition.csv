To minimise future conflict with utilities in new developments, where trees are proposed within the footway or highway build outs, the creation of a common utility enclosure with the necessary provisions for safely including both mains services and ducting should be considered in the utility design. This is preferably located adjacent to the property front boundary, under the footway, to facilitate service connections. The developer is to consider the requirements of National Joint Utilities Group guidance volume 4 with regard to the installation of trees and the required installation and maintenance of statutory undertakers apparatus. http://streetworks.org.uk/wp content/uploads/V4-Trees-Issue-2-16-11-2007.pdf
