# planning-condition-data

This repository is for storing planning condition data whilst we are piloting the [planning condition data specification](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/planning-condition/).

The data will be collected and published on [planning.data.gov.uk](https://planning.data.gov.uk).

Once planning authorities start publishing their planning condition data on their own sites we will be able to shut down this repository.
